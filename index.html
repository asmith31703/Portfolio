    <!-- Process explanation -->
    <div>
      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <div class="project-summary">
  <h5>Problem</h5>
  <p>
    Sales reps across different business units had varying levels of product knowledge and inconsistent messaging, making it 
      hard to confidently position solutions to customers.
  </p>

  <h5>Goal</h5>
  <p>
    Create a unified, interactive e-learning course that equips all sales reps with consistent language, practical conversation skills, 
      and confidence to recommend the right solutions.
  </p>
</div>
      <div class="process-section">
  <h3>My Approach</h3>

  <h5>1. Looked for the Gaps</h5>
  <p>
    I started by digging into the existing training materials and chatting with key people—like the VP of Sales and a distributor—to really understand where 
      things weren’t clicking. What I found was interesting:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Distributors wanted clear positioning language, not just product specs.</li>
    <li>Internal sales reps needed more confidence to recommend solutions beyond their usual business units.</li>
    <li>Everyone agreed that consistent messaging and helpful starter phrases would make a big difference.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>2. Mapped Learning to Real Sales Conversations</h5>
  <p>
    Using what I learned, I built a course map focused on what sales reps actually do day-to-day—not just dumping product info. 
      Each rep shoudl finish this course and feel confident and ready to engage in a conversation with a client! Every module answers the question:<br>
    <em>“How would a rep use this in a real conversation with a customer?”</em>
  </p>

  <h5>3. Created Interactive, Modular Content</h5>
  <p>
    Then I created 5 courses for the Motion Safety Business Unit focused on their main product categories. You can scroll through a Wheel Chock course at the top of the page! Notice some of the specific design features used in the course: 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>“Starting the Conversation” blocks give reps a reliable way to open talks. The process block allows them to almost have exposure therapy to the anxiety that 
        can come with a sales meeting. </li>
<img src="Sales Conversation.png" alt="Conversation Starter Example" style="max-width:350px; width:100%; margin-bottom:10px;">
    <li>Cross-selling prompts gently remind them of opportunities to bundle solutions! They offer not only WHY the product pairs, but an example quote to integrate the 
        cross sell into the conversation and what parts of a facility to look out for! This is especially helpful for Business Unit specific sales reps without information on other JSG products!</li>
<img src="Cross Sell.png" alt="Conversation Starter Example" style="max-width:350px; width:100%; margin-bottom:10px;">
    <li>Table blocks displaying the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of the product allows reps to directly answer customer objections and have concrete numbers to respond with! </li>
<img src="TCO.png" alt="Conversation Starter Example" style="max-width:350px; width:100%; margin-bottom:10px;">
  </ul>

    </div>
<div class="assessment-process">
  <h3>My Assessment Process</h3>

  <h3>1. Modeled Scenarios on Real Sales Conversations</h3>
  <p>
    I designed each scenario to mirror the sample sales conversations from the product courses. Every scenario starts with identifying hazards and asking about safety regulations, then moves through connecting users with products, handling objections, and spotting cross-selling opportunities. Each product is sold in a different industry, so reps get to practice with a variety of stakeholders and real-world situations.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Built Interactive Feedback in Storyline</h3>
  <p>
    In Storyline, I created a “Satisfaction” variable that rises or falls based on the user’s choices. 
      If a rep makes three mistakes in a scenario, the client becomes “dissatisfied” and the conversation ends—prompting the user to retry that section or exit the assessment. This approach encourages thoughtful responses and prevents brute-forcing, but also lets users revisit only the scenarios they need to improve.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Visualized Progress with a Customer Sentiment Bar</h3>
  <p>
    To make feedback immediate and engaging, I added a “Customer Sentiment” bar at the bottom of the screen. As users make decisions, the bar shifts left or right, visually showing how each step of the conversation affects the client’s perception—not just the final result.

              <!-- Process explanation -->
<div>
  <h3>Project Overview</h3>
  <div class="project-summary">
    <h5>Problem</h5>
    <p>
      Students were unsure what services the Career Center offered or how to find the right support for their needs. When they scheduled meetings with Career Advisors, most of the time was spent figuring out what the student didn’t know—instead of actually working toward a solution.
    </p>

    <h5>Goal</h5>
    <p>
      Create a tool that helps students help themselves, so meetings can focus on sharing <b>knowledge</b> rather than just uncovering what’s missing.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="process-section">
    <h3>My Approach</h3>

    <h5>1. Analyzing Current Materials</h5>
    <p>
      The original draft was a 10-question multiple choice quiz covering career skills like resume building and interviewing. It was a good start, but it missed the real issue: students don’t know what they don’t know. For example, a freshman who hasn’t looked at their resume since high school probably just thinks it’s “old”—but doesn’t know what’s missing or how to fix it. I wanted to flip the perspective and design from the learner’s point of view.
    </p>
    <!-- Step 1 image: Document -->
    <img src="step1-document.png" alt="Reviewing Original Quiz Document" style="max-width:350px; width:100%; margin-bottom:10px;">

    <h5>2. Creating a Scenario-Based Flow Chart</h5>
    <p>
      Instead of focusing on skills, I designed a scenario-based flow chart that walks students through real-life situations where career skills matter. If the chart asks about interview prep and a student says “I have no idea,” it gives a quick explanation and points them to the right Career Center resources. No more scrolling through 80+ PDFs—this chart connects students directly to what they need, without the overwhelm.
    </p>
    <!-- Step 2 image: Document -->
    <img src="step2-flowchart.png" alt="Scenario-Based Flow Chart" style="max-width:350px; width:100%; margin-bottom:10px;">

    <h5>3. Adapting to an Interactive Format</h5>
    <p>
      Using Google Slides and a clean template from SlideCarnaval, I added bookmarks so students can click through scenarios at their own pace, exploring different paths and resources. Now, students can spot their own knowledge gaps and confidently take the first step toward career readiness.
